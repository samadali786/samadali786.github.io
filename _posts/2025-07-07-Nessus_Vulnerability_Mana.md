# Overview

In this Vulnerability Management project, I used a Nessus vulnerability scanner tool to scan the Windows 10 VM host which was hosted on my local machine on the same network using the Oracle Virtual Box as a hypervisor. Nessus is a commercial and a popular vulnerability management tool which allows the SOC Analyst to perform different types of vulnerability scans on single or multiple hosts on the network. In this project, I used Nessus Estentials vulnerability management scanner tool to perform the basic network scans. The following are the types of scan that I performed on the Windows 10 VM host to find the different types of vulnerabilities.

1) Non-Credential scan.<br>
2) Credential scan.<br>
3) Credential scan with deprecated VLC media player software .<br>
4) Credential scan with updated VLC media player software.  

Types of Scan that I performed on Windows 10 VM host using Nessus:

# Setting up the Windows 10 VM host on my Local Machine

In this step, I used the Windows 10 OS “.ISO” image file to boot up onto the Oracle Virtual Box. Before booting up, I changed the network settings from “NAT” to “Bridge Adapter” so that the Windows 10 VM host shares the same network which is used by my local machine with different IP addresses by hosts. The following are the steps that I used to test the connection between the Windows 10 VM host and the local machine.

# Pinging from the Local host to the Windows 10 VM host

I used the “ipconfig” command to find out the IPV4 addresses of both the local and Windows 10 VM machines. After finding the IPv4 addresses, I used the “ping 192.168.1.21 -t” command with the IPv4 address of the Windows 10 VM machine from my local machine to test the connection. On the first attempt, I was unable to connect to the Windows 10 VM host with the “Request timed out” error, so I fixed it by turning the “Firewall Status” to “off” in “Domain Profile”, “Public Profile”, and “Private Profile” inside the Windows Defender from the Windows 10 VM host following are the snapshots of the steps.

# 1. Non-Credential Scan using Nessus Scanning Tool

In this step to perform the non credential scan using Nessus Essentials I started with the "Basic Network Scan" first and then by clicking on the "New Scan" to set up the non-credential scan. From the setting tab I gave the name of the scan and the Target host IPv4 address "192.168.1.21" of the Windows 10 VM host and then save the settings and run the non-credential scan.

# Results of Non-Credential Scan using Nessus Scanning Tool

The scan took some time to perform and, finally provided the non-credential scanning results, I noticed that there were 26 info's with 1 medium vulnerability found by Nessus. After analyzing the medium vulnerability, I found there was a "SMB signing not required" vulnerability found on the Windows 10 VM host that was related to an SMB server that uses unauthentication to authenticate the remote host for file, printer, and other resources over the network which could be exploited by an attacker as a man-in-the-middle attacks. In the info's I found another important info that was related to non-credential scanning by Nessus with the name "Target Credential Status by Authentication Protocol" whcih shows that Nessus was unable to scan all the Protocols and required to perform a Credential scan to get more effective results, following are the scan result and the vulnerabilities found by Nessus.

# 2. Credential Scan using Nessus Scanning Tool

To perform the credential scan I setup the Windows 10 VM host first so that it accept the authenticated scans, and then provide the credentials to Nessus to
perform the credential scans.


# Enable the Remote Registry Service, and File and Printer Sharing Settings

In this step I enabled the Remote Service by going to the Services, and changing the Remote Registry Service Status type to "Automatic" and then from Advance Sharing Settings, and then under the File Printer Sharing settings I turned on the file and printer sharing, following are the snapshots of the steps.

Enable File and Printer Sharing settings in Windows 10 VM host:
![file_prt_enab](assets/img/VulnMang1/file_print_shar_enable.png)

# Changing up the User Account Control Settings and Adding Registry Key

In this step I changed the User Account settings to "Never Notify" soo the Nessus scanner can scan the Windows 10 VM host without any interuptions from the Windows 10 VM host. In the next step I adding the registry key "LocalAccountFilterPolicy" and set it's value to "1" to allow the remote account to connect, and to make it more easy for Nessus scanner to scan the Windows 10 VM host, after that I restarted the Windows 10 VM host.

# Results of Credential Scan using Nessus Scanning Tool

In this step from the Nessus scanner, I setup another new scan for the Credential scan, and gave the name of the scan and the target host IP address which was the same one that I used for the Non-Crendential scan. From the scan settings I added the set of credentials for the Windows, and then provided the User name and password of the Windows 10 VM host soo that the Nessus scanner can peform the credential scanning, and then save the settings and run the scan.


After the scanner was performing the scan I found the very diffrent results than the Non-Credential scans with more critical and medium vulnerabilities. From the critical vulnerabilities list one of the critical vulnerability that I found was realted to Microsoft 365 Office app that could be affected or exploited by the remote code execution, to remedidate this vulnerability it was required to update MS 365 Office app to version 11.0 or later versions.

# 3. Credential Scan with the Deprecated VLC media player Software

In this step I performed the credential scan by installing the deprecated version or older version of the VLC media player software to check if Nessus scanner can able to find the deprecated VLC media player software vulnerability. I installed the outdated and depreacted VLC media player version 3.0.0 on Windows 10 VM host, and then start the new credential scan from Nessus scanner. 


Deprecated VLC media player version 3.0.0 installed on Windows 10 VM host:

# Results of Credential Scan with the Deperecated VLC media player using Nessus Scanning Tool

In this step from the Nessus scanner, I setup another new Credential scan, and gave the new name of the scan and the target host IP address which was the same one that I used for the Crendential scan above. From the scan settings I add the sets of credentials for the Windows, and then provided the user name and password of the Windows 10 VM host again soo that the Nessus scanner can peform the credential scanning, and then save the settings and run the scan.


After performing the credential scan on Windows 10 VM host with the deperecated VLC Media player using Nessus scanner, it detected 4 critical vulnerabilities related to VLC media player in Windows 10 VM host, these vulnerabilities were "DoS (denial-of-service)", "exploitable code execution", "Integer underflow" "Buffer Overflow" and "NULL pointer de-reference", which can be remidiated by updating VLC media player version 3.0.9 and higher, following are the snapshot of the steps from the Nessus scanner.   

Four critical vulnerabilities found in the deprecated version of VLC Media Player in Windows 10 VM host:

# 4. Credential Scan with the Updated VLC media player software

In this step I performed the credential scan with the updated VLC Media Player software version 3.0.20 on Windows 10 VM host. First I updated the VLC media player directly from the VLC media player software. I also updated Windows 10 VM host and installed the pending updates and then restarted the Windows 10 VM host machine, and then started the new credential scan from Nessus scanner.    

VLC Media Player updated to version 3.0.20 in Windows 10 VM host:
![vlc_med_upd](assets/img/VulnMang1/vlc_media_up_3.0.20.png)


Windows 10 OS updated on Windows 10 VM host:
![win_10_upd](assets/img/VulnMang1/windows_10_update.png)



# Results of Credential Scan with the Updated VLC media player and Windows 10 VM host using Nessus Scanning Tool

In this step from the Nessus scanner, I setup another new Credential scan, and gave the new name of the scan and the target host IP address which was the same one that I used before, and using the same set of credentials for the Windows 10 VM host, that I used in my previous credential scans, and then save the settings and ran the scan.


After performing the credential scan on the updated Windows 10 VM host with the updated VLC Media player using Nessus scanner, In my first scan I still found 2 critical vulnerabilities in VLC media player version 3.0.20 which required to upgrade to VLC media player version 3.0.21 because of the updated Windows 10 VM host. After running my second scan with upgraded version 3.0.21 of the VLC media player, the scanner was not able found any critical vulnerabilities related to VLC media player and just showing 1 info about free portable media player installed on the host related to VLC media player.

VLC media player updated to version 3.0.20 to 3.0.21 in Windows 10 VM host:
![vlc_3.0.21](assets/img/VulnMang1/VLC_media_player_3.0.21.png)

# Conclusion

In this Vulnerability Management project I learned how to use Nessus Essential vulnerability scaning tool to perform Non-Credential, Credential, Credential with deperecated software (VLC media player), and Credential with updated software (VLC media player) scans on a Windows 10 VM host which is hosted on my local maschine on the same network. While performing the scans using Nessus Essentials I figured out sometimes Nessus Essential scanner not able to connect to the Windows 10 VM host, and takes multiple attempts to connect which takes quite sometime. Moreover, I also learned how to read, and analyze the results of the Nessus scans related to these vulnerabilities and how to correctly remidate these vulnerabilities.
